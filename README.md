# C-sharp-Homework
C# homework
In the first file is given the Conditional part of the homework, in the second part - the Arrays.
It was chosen to not write each exercise in a different file due to several factors, including me, not having access to any compilers except online ones, and also to take lesser space.
Each exercise is written in a different function, and then it's work is shown in the Main() function.

Thank you for your attention!
